HUMAN.0
=======

HUMAN.0 is an open source physical card game that aims to illustrate the complex phylosophical issues around the concept of Post-Humanism through the metaphor of a "body shop" of biomimetic implants.

In the game the players must make complex decisions to adapt their body to a changing environment and ultimately achieve their survival goals.

The game was developed by Bárbara Teixeira, Helen Okada, José Raimundo, Marinela Freitas and Pedro Ângelo during the [EMERGENCE@UPorto Science Communication Hackathon](http://uporto.emergencehackathon.com/2019.html) in September 2019.
